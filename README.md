# typers-are-fast
Can anybody type faster than 550 wpm? You probably might not be able to. Beating people typing has always been my dream, but I am a slow typer at only 25-30 wpm. But, should we break the world record and become a 1000 wpm typer? This is a Python script that uses BeautifulSoup v4 for scraping the HTML and getting a result, pyautogui for checking the GUI, time for adding an interval, keyboard for adding hotkeys, and requests for permisssion to scrape the website. In just 60 lines of code, you can type so fast, so type fast and have a lot of fun crushing people in your favourite typing games!
